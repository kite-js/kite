# Kite in action

Let's assume a scenario to build a reallife project: 

A content manage system which is able to login, create users, list users, 
assign role to a user, create articles, update articles. The system has 
2 roles "administrator" and "editor", administrator has the privilege of
doing everything in this system, editor has the privilege of managing articles.

# Preparatory



In this project, we use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) for data storage.
